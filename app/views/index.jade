				p
					| We run a LaTeX compiler in the cloud which listens for changes to your Github repository.
					| When you make a change, we compile the latest content and host the PDF and log files for
					| you.
					
				p
					| You can embed a badge into your project's README or website so that you can see the latest
					| compile status and access the PDF with a single click.
